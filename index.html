							<p class="my-4">"We used Yorkshire Floral Co for our wedding flowers as we had seen Lucy's work on Instagram and really liked the style of flowers. It was a great alternative to using all fresh flowers, as it was much more economical for the types of designs we wanted, and it also felt better for the environment to rent flowers rather than
								use fresh and they just be thrown away after. </p>
							<p class="my-4">Lucy was great from the start, she was super friendly and had great comms, always replying to emails in a timely manner, and she really made us feel at ease. The flowers on the day were stunning, even better than I expected. We had compliments from the guests on how lovely they looked, especially the broken flower arch which became a 
								photo point for many and really added to how pretty the venue looked. Lucy even helped set up our tables to make sure the florals fit in with our decor and we rented some extra candles from her too. It all went perfectly and we couldn't have been happier with how they all looked on the day. Thank you so much!!"</p>

							<p class="my-4">The service that went with the flowers was second to none, nothing was ever too much trouble and Lucy kept me informed every step of the way, having conversations with me to discuss colours and design ideas and generally being a sounding board around general wedding conversations.</p>

							<p class="my-4">Lucy's vision and inspiration was perfect for our day and she decorated our room so beautifully, creating the most gorgeous centrepieces, bridal and bridesmaid bouquets, button holes and the most incredible flower girl crowns!
